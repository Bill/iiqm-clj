;; Now I'd like to define the iiqm function. It calls prefix-sum-at and nth.

;; by defining a meter is a losing battle. It seems we have to be all-in on defining a new type.
;; But let's try to hack our way through it with plain old functions and see how far we can get...

;; on the tree's meter defining :count which is the number of elements in the tree.

  csr-tree)

  This will become the (SplitAt) ft-split-at function on the new type."

      ;; Specifying three conditions instead of only two seems overly fussy. But I'm copying what finger-tree does.

          [pre m post])
      :else [c-tree notfound (empty-count c-tree)])))

(defn nth-count [c-tree n]
  "Return the nth element from the tree. The tree's meter must define :count which is the number of elements in the
  tree.This will become the (Indexed) nth function on the new collection type."
  (second (ft-split-at-count c-tree n)))

;; Second, we define the functions pertaining to the "summed" nature of our collection. Each of these depends on the
;; tree's meter defining :sum which is the sum of the elements (values) in the tree.

(defn prefix-sum-at [csr-tree n]
  "Return the sum of the first n elements of the (sorted) tree. Tree must be sorted (somehow) and its meter must define
  :sum which is the sum of the elements."
  (let [[left _ _] (ft-split-at-count csr-tree (inc n))] (:sum (measured left))))

;; Third, and last, we define the IIQM (incremental interquartile mean) function.
