  tree.This will become the (Indexed) nth function on the new collection type."
  (second (ft-split-at-count c-tree n)))

;; Second, we define the functions pertaining to the "summed" nature of our collection. Each of these depends on the
;; tree's meter defining :sum which is the sum of the elements (values) in the tree.

  :sum which is the sum of the elements."
